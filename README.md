# chiemerie_sug

A Flutter project I built for a friend(Chiemerie Victor) who contested for the Governor of Student Union Government(SUG) at University of Nigeria, Nsukka Campus.

## Description

This project was initially created by a UI/UX designer using the figma tool. 

Below is the link to the design on figma:

- [Title:Untitled](https://www.figma.com/file/OWi99rRrZbp9K0CpQ3xB26/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1),

*Although, few changes were made during the work, which were not implemented in the design.


### Packages

This project was built with the aid of packages from pub.dart

Marquee: Which was resonsible for the infinity text scrolling at the top of the site.

Url_Launcher: It helped in the launchng of Url(especialy those redirecting to whatsapp pages).

Layout: A layout builder was employed to achieve a proper responsive design for all devices



This project lasted for 2 days.# chiemerie_sug
